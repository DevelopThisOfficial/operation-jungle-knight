    <h1>New Run page</h1>
    <p>If a user starts a new run, this is where they go. Any pre-run selections happen here, before being sent to the first "encounter select" screen.</p>
    <p>The main one to start will be the ability to manually input a "seed" for the run, or to have one randomly generated.</p>
